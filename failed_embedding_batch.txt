too tight in my left mid part right side is ok though
my husband typically wears size 8 men shoes and because he had wide feet size 9 was recommended when he tried these shoes on it was way too big
too small need to return for a larger size

this is my 3rd pair of vessi others have been perfect for my very narrow foot these are too wide except at the heal
i need a wide git
my shoe size is 85 last pair i ordered it was size 9 and its too small was too big this time i bought size 8 and it is too small
not tall enough
size 7 is a bit too tight will try size 8
dont fit my kids feet
